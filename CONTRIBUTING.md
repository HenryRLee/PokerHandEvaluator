# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to PHEvaluator. Here are some advice might be useful for passing the code review.

* The Coding Style is to use 2-space indentations in C++, and 4-space indentations in Python. An [.editorconfig](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator/blob/master/.editorconfig) file has also been created, which [most editors support natively](https://editorconfig.org/).
* Split your work into multiple Pull Request if they are irrelevant, so that we can merge them independently (usually with squash merge).
